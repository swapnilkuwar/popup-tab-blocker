# Popup Tab Blocker

Popup Tab Blocker is a lightweight Chrome extension that prevents websites from opening unwanted new tabs and popup windows.

You can enable or disable blocking **per site**, giving you full control over your browsing experience.

## ✨ Features

- Block tabs and popups on a per-site basis
- One-click enable / disable from the extension popup
- Visual ON/OFF status with toolbar icon
- Counts how many popups were blocked
- No ads, no tracking, no content injection

## 🧩 How It Works

Popup Tab Blocker listens for new tabs or windows created by a website.
If blocking is enabled for that site, the new tab is immediately closed.

The extension does **not**:

- Block page content
- Modify website HTML
- Inject scripts into pages

All settings are stored locally in your browser.
